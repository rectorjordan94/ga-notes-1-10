## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Palindrome"

### Objectives

- Create a function which takes a string (`str`) as an argument and determines if the string is a palindrome.
- The output should return a boolean, which should be `true` to pass the test.

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail at first.)
- Give the problem a go and when you're ready, run the test!

### Notes

- The string can include letters and spaces.
- You will need to account for spaces– for example, "a man a plan a canal panama" should return `true`.
