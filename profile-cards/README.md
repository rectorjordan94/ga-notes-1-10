## Intro

Time for some practice laying out elements using Flexbox and CSS Grid!

This lab is **not a deliverable**.

- Choose either the vertical or horizontal "profile card" above to reproduce using HTML and CSS.

- Use a combination of Flexbox and CSS Grid to layout the individual elements as close as possible - however, it does not have to be perfect!

## Set Up

Use either an HTML, CSS, JS Repl, or create a project folder with `index.html` & `css/main.css` files - your choice.

## Hints

- Be sure to start with a bit of CSS reset:

	```css
		* {
		  box-sizing: border-box;
		}
		
		body {
		  margin: 0;
		  font-family: Helvetica;
		}
	```

- Use the _Digital Color Meter_ application that comes with the Mac to "pick" the colors from the screen.

- Elements can be made to appear circular by using `border-radius: 50%;`.

- As an image placeholder feel free to use picsum

```html
<img src="https://picsum.photos/200/200" alt="john" />
```

- To have access to the icons we are using font awesome which is already set up in the html. The star has been provided, but research the font awesome documentation on how to get the other icons.
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
```html
<i class="fas fa-star"></i> <!-- star -->

```

## Bonus

As a bonus, reproduce both the vertical and horizontal versions!
