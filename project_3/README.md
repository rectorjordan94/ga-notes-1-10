# Project 3

### Overview

You’ve already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time **we’re going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your own project, your instructors will partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an application of your own design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It can be a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely what you'll be doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.** In fact, in some regards, working on a team makes things much easier, and it's nice to have people to run ideas by and get help from.

Make it work, and make it awesome.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own back-end API and your own front-end client
* **Have an interactive front-end**, built with react, you can choose to use the boilerplate or `create-react-app`
* **Be a complete product**, which means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models(or subdocuments). You must also either use a third-party API or use seeded data with sufficient quantity/complexity.
* **Use a database**, use mongoDb via mongoose to save data
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible (we will discuss in class)

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working app, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section in each of your Github repos
* **TWO** Github repos, one for the API, and one for the client
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project.
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
  * Include a screenshot of the site in repo's README
  * Explanations of the **technologies** used
  * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  * Your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  * Your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application - **EMBEDDED IN YOUR README**
  * Your **ERDS** - Entity Relationship Diagrams - **EMBEDDED IN YOUR README**
  * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use** In fact, you should most likely tackle your APIs first.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your app to be RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* **Project Workflow**: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in \(detailed above\)?
* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?
* **Creativity**: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user \(not just a login button and an index page\)?
* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors as we have in class?
* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrated that you thought through alternative implementations? _\(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.\)_
* **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

| Score | Expectations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **0** | _Incomplete._ |
| **1** | _Does not meet expectations._ |
| **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_ |
| **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_ |

This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but **the more important scores are the individual ones** above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

## Need Some Inspiration?

You can make an app about anything you and your team wants! However sometimes it is difficult to come up with something without a specific prompt. For those that want to use it, here is a sample prompt:

### Premise: Startup in a Week

Your team has been put together in order to create a startup around a particular idea. In one week, you're expected to flesh out your ideas as a group and create a MVP \(Minimum Viable Product\). Since you'll be answering to investors \(the class and your instructors\), keep the following in mind:

* What is your application \(elevator pitch, ideally in one sentence\)
* What value does your application provide to your audience?
* What steps have you taken to entice users? \(user experience, a fancy frontend, trying out functionality before being forced to signup\)
