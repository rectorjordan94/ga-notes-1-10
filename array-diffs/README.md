## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Array Diffs"

### Objectives

- Create a function that takes two arrays of integers (`arr1` and `arr2`) and checks for the unique (non-shared) integers between them.
- The output should return an array with all the unique numbers (the numbers that are **not** in both arrays).

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail at first.)
- Get hacking on the problem, test when you think you've got it, and use your resources!
