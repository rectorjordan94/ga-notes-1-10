# Algorithm Practice

Enhance your problem sovling ability and prepare for technical interviews with algorithm practice!

## Getting Started
* Fork and clone this repository to your computer
* Create a new branch to store your work
* Create an `attempts.js` file in this directory

## Deliverable Requirements
* For each algorithm that you attempt, record the name of the algorithm, your final attempt of the algorithm, and whether or not your attempt passed the test in `attempt.js`


## Practice Problems

### Requirements
* Start at the top and work your way down
* Follow the instructions in each repo to fork, clone, attempt the algo, and run the tests.

### The Algorithms

* [Does Include](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/does-include)
* [Palindrome](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/palindrome)
* [Array Diffs](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/array-diffs)
* [Odds from Evens](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/odds-from-evens)
* [Remove Spaces](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/remove-spaces)
* [Insert Index](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/insert-index)
* [Sum in All Array](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/sum-all-in-array)
* [Factorialize](https://git.generalassemb.ly/sei-ec-remote/factorialize)


### Tips

* Pseudocode!
* Get out some handy dandy documentation! Reminding yourself of JS basics, like string methods, array methods, things you can do with Math, etc. will help you.
* Google is your best friend! If you come across a direct solution though, be sure you are breaking things down and researching to understand WHY something worked that way. Dont' just copy and paste. This is learning exercise.
* Your classmates will know things you don't! And bouncing ideas off each other can often bring solutions.
* Once you have solved an algorithm, you can rework it to see if you can make the code more DRY.
