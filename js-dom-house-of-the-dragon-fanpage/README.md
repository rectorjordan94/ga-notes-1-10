# House of the Dragon!


You've been tasked with building a House of the Dragon fan page, featuring your
favorite characters and a short bio for each one. You can't truly honor fire & blood with a static HTML/CSS page. You need to add some
interactivity!

## Prerequisites

- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- DOM Manipulation

## Instructions

This will be like a personal mini project! 

1. Create a new repo for this in your **personal Github** (*not Github Enterprise*)
2. Submit what you've created at the end of the week using the Homework Submission Form.

## Requirements

Using HTML, CSS, and JS, create a fan site with the following elements:

1. Six character cards with the name of the character, a photo, and two buttons. Characters are as follows: Rhaenyra Targaryen, Alicent Hightower, King Viserys, Daemon Targaryen, Laenor Velaryon, Laena Velaryon (swap them out for others if you'd like!).
2. When one button is clicked, a short bio of the character should appear beneath their image.  When the other button is clicked, text should appear under their image that reveals whether the character is still alive or is dead.
3. Add search functionality to the page that allows the user to filter characters.
4. Style to your heart's desire! Take inspiration from the show and add whatever personal touches you'd like.

Be sure to adhere to semantic HTML best practices, and to use the concepts KISS and DRY!


## Bonus

- Create a button that, when clicked, arranges all characters in alphabetical
  order.

- Create another button that randomly shuffles the characters.

- Add other functionality and interactivity as you see fit.
