## Mini Algorithm Exercise

"Odds From Evens"

### Objectives

- Create an algorithm which takes a given array of integers (arr) and separates the odds from the evens.
- The output should be a new array which has all even integers (ordered from lowest to highest) followed by all odd integers (ordered from highest to lowest).

> i.e.:
> input => `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
> output => `[0,2,4,6,8,9,7,5,3,1]`

### Getting Started

- Fork and clone this repo.
- Run `npm i` from within the repo.
- Run `npm run test` or `npm test` to make sure the tests work. (They should fail.)
- Get hacking on the problem and test when you think you've got it! Remember to use your resources.
